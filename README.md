The design for SteveBarman.com, figured I'd open source it because why not? I'll be making it more back-end friendly over time so that more options are in the backend of WordPress. 

This is a child theme of [HTML5 Blank](https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank) for wordpress. HTML5 Blank is required to make this site work properly.
